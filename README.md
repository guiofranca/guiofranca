Hello!

I am Guilherme França, a brazilian Electrical Engineer currently working as a Developer/IT guy.

I'm currently maintaining a home-assistant server and learning a lot from it. Building home automations with ESP32 and ESP8266 boards, things like turn on the lights or ventilator and inside vs outside temperatures and such.

I intend to store here on github some sort of portfolio to showcase my work.
